3) switch all code to GLKVector, need to see how to do in ColorImage, maybe just in binary image is enougth
4) check what is faster and how much, class or struct and consider switching, result of searching- strcut are on stack and classes on heap, therefore sometimes much faster. worth checking
5) other time improvments, such as switching rotated rectangle and etc to UnSafeMutablePointer
7) create a general image protocol and extend it to be used as abstract class
